Very good work on this assignment, Jose! The overall flow of the application functions pretty well.
A few things that need to improve about the application.
- Additional time isn't subtracted from the timer if a question is answered incorrectly.
- I suggest using validation to ensure that users cannot click the "Begin Tests" button without entering input.
- Additionally, make sure to include a screenshot of the application, a description, and the deployed application URL in
 the README.
Great work!
